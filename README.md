## philosophy

if a beginner is having a bad time installing packages, there is not a bug in ce.
if dependencies, requirements, unexpected errors start showing up to a user, there is not a bug in the user, there is a bug in ce. 

## explain it!
### casually!

People aren't writing great documentation anymore. 

Our people are not properly guided as we were before. 
We need better trade deals. We need to build a wall. 

A wall that will keep infinite pages of technical hocus pocus out, and helpful guides and references IN. abyssexplorer will make documents readable... again. 
No rabbit holes on stackexchange, overflow and nerd meeting grounds just to follow the steps in the manual.  That's what it was supposed to be there for. 

Instead you are forced to look it up, one thing leads to another, and you'll forgetting what you were even working on. 

again.

if a noob is having a bad time, there is a bug in the documentation. 

if a noob can't install the packages with the resources already in the repository, there is something wrong with the repository.  If a file conflicts with requirements, it is a bug with x. 

content, especiallly documentation should be simple, yet consider all of the possible hurdles and tricky dependencies conflicting with your system. abyssexplorer is an attempt to get you through the hurdle without ever having to do a google search because it's assumed you know what things mean and how they work.  

# casually explained is an attempt for a step toward real documents, the best documents around, it's gonna be great. Again!
