There are several tools you will find on ParrotOS that are very helpful. For creating a bootable flash drive of Parrot OS, the recommended way to do so is by using Rosa, more information here:

Etcher is the one I have personal experience with and can verify that it works

It can be a very powerful thing to have an external OS in your backpocket.

ParrotOS is security oriented and comes with an extensive toolkit, not unlike Kali, it's completely sandboxed.

 Let’s discuss a few such tools —

AnonSurf

Being anonymous for a hacker is the first step before hacking a system.

You already have heard the line, every hacker changes his night at midnight.
I don’t want to go too much into it, but parrot has Anonsurf preinstalled and configured, so if you are doing something stealthy and want to be anonymous, you can cloak yourself with just one click.

Wifiphisher

It is a rogue Access Point framework used for conducting Wi-Fi security testing. Using Wifiphisher, penetration testers can easily achieve a man-in-the-middle position against wireless clients by performing targeted Wi-Fi association attacks. Wifiphisher can be further used to mount victim-customized web phishing attacks against the connected clients in order to capture credentials or infect the victim stations with malware.
