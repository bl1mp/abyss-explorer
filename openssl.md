### alert!: 
if you do not have openssl installed, you will have to install it first. An easy way to do this is by using brew package manager or whatever is suitable for you. For brew, type brew.sh and copy the contents of the code displayed on the homepage into your terminal, and follow the steps.

*if you do not have internet access type in man openssl*
